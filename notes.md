## Autoencoder → VAE

### Why Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)?
Generative models can make brand-new random outputs, but often you want to **explore/alter existing data** in a specific direction — VAEs are especially good at this.

### Standard Autoencoder
- Two networks: **encoder** (input → small dense encoding) + **decoder** (encoding → reconstruct input)
- Trained via **reconstruction loss** (MSE or cross-entropy between output and input)
- Encoder is forced to discard unimportant info, keep only what's needed to reconstruct

The problem

- The latent space learned this way is **not continuous** — it forms disconnected clusters
- Fine for reconstructing known inputs, but bad for generation: sampling a random point between clusters → decoder has never seen that region → garbage output

### What VAEs change
- Encoder outputs **two vectors** instead of one encoding: a mean vector **μ** and a std-dev vector **σ**
- These define a distribution per input; the actual encoding is **sampled** from N(μ, σ²)
- Same input → slightly different encoding every pass (stochastic)
- Intuition: μ = where the encoding is centered, σ = how much it's allowed to vary
- Because decoder sees many sampled variations of the same input during training, it learns nearby points in latent space also decode sensibly → smooths the space **locally**

### Loss Function

$$
\mathcal{L}_{VAE} = \mathcal{L}_{recon} + \mathcal{L}_{KL}
$$

#### Reconstruction loss
- the same as that used in MLP, can be Binary Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error, etc.
- purely **reconstruction loss** (see below)

#### KL loss
- Add KL divergence term to the loss: penalizes how far the learned distribution (μ, σ) is from a standard normal N(0, I)
- purely **KL loss** (see below): Pulls all encodings toward the center, densely packed, evenly spread

### Code

#### Encoding section: encoder + reparameterization trick

```python
# build your encoder upto here. It can simply be a series of dense layers, a convolutional network
# or even an LSTM decoder. Once made, flatten out the final layer of the encoder, call it hidden.

# we use Keras to build the graph

latent_size = 5
mean = Dense(latent_size)(hidden)

# we usually don't directly compute the stddev σ 
# but the log of the stddev instead, which is log(σ)
# the reasoning is similar to why we use softmax, instead of directly outputting
# numbers in fixed range [0, 1], the network can output a wider range of numbers which we can later compress down
log_stddev = Dense(latent_size)(hidden)

def sampler(mean, log_stddev):
    # we sample from the standard normal a matrix of batch_size * latent_size (taking into account minibatches)
    std_norm = K.random_normal(shape=(K.shape(mean)[0], latent_size), mean=0, stddev=1)
    # sampling from Z~N(μ, σ^2) is the same as sampling from μ + σX, X~N(0,1)
    return mean + K.exp(log_stddev) * std_norm
  
latent_vector = Lambda(sampler)([mean, log_stddev])
# pass latent_vector as input to decoder layers
```

#### Loss section

```python
def vae_loss(input_img, output):
    # compute the average MSE error, then scale it up i.e. simply sum on all axes
    reconstruction_loss = K.sum(K.square(output-input_img))
    # compute the KL loss
    kl_loss = -0.5 * K.sum(1 + log_stddev - K.square(mean) - K.square(K.exp(log_stddev)), axis=-1)
    # return the average loss over all images in batch
    total_loss = K.mean(reconstruction_loss + kl_loss)
    return total_loss
```
## Generator vs Discriminator → GAN

### [Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks](https://naokishibuya.github.io/blog/2017-11-03-understanding-generative-adversarial-networks/)

**Background**
- GAN proposed by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, et al. in 2014
- Two parts: **generator** (generates images) + **discriminator** (classifies real vs fake)

### The Generator
- Input: **latent samples** — a series of randomly generated numbers (e.g. 100 random numbers)
- Output: reshaped into image size (e.g. 784 → 28×28 for MNIST)
- Simple fully-connected architecture: Dense → LeakyReLU → Dense → **tanh** activation
- tanh is recommended for GAN training (per "How to Train a GAN? Tips and tricks"); requires rescaling images to [-1, 1]
- Without training, generator produces pure garbage — needs the GAN loop to actually learn

### The Discriminator
- A **classifier** trained via supervised learning: real (1) vs fake (0)
- Trained on both real MNIST images (should output "real") and generator's fake images (should output "fake")
- Also fully-connected: Dense → LeakyReLU → Dense → **sigmoid** activation (outputs probability between 0 and 1)

### The GAN (connecting the two)
- GAN = generator → discriminator, chained together
- Feed a latent sample into the GAN → generator produces an image internally → discriminator classifies it

### Training the GAN means Training the Generator
- Feed latent samples through the GAN, label = 1 ("real") — this is what we *want* the generator to achieve
- Generator starts bad → high loss → backprop updates generator's weights to produce more realistic images
- **Key catch**: during generator training, the discriminator must be set **non-trainable** — it's only being used as a fixed classifier/judge in this step, not being updated itself

### The Train Loop
Discriminator and generator are trained **in turn**, alternating:
1. Set discriminator **trainable**
2. Train discriminator on real MNIST images + generator's fake images → learn to classify real vs fake
3. Set discriminator **non-trainable**
4. Train generator (via the full GAN): feed latent samples → generator produces images → discriminator classifies → backprop only updates generator

Repeat until neither can improve further (ideally).

### But does it work?
- Results are mixed — some generated digits look good, others don't
- Training GANs needs a lot of empirical hacks (e.g. label smoothing) — referenced: [ganhacks by Soumith Chintala et al., Facebook AI Research](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks)
- **Training imbalance problems observed**:
  - If discriminator trains much faster than generator → generator gives up learning
  - In some cases, generator learns to fool the discriminator so well the discriminator stops learning to classify correctly
- Suggests more complex architectures like **DCGAN** (Deep Convolutional GAN) could improve results over this simple fully-connected version

### Code (Keras)

**Generator**
```python
generator = Sequential([
    Dense(128, input_shape=(100,)),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Dense(784),
    Activation('tanh')
], name='generator')
```

**Discriminator**
```python
discriminator = Sequential([
    Dense(128, input_shape=(784,)),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Dense(1),
    Activation('sigmoid')
], name='discriminator')
```

**Connecting into a GAN**
```python
gan = Sequential([
    generator,
    discriminator
])

gan.summary()
```

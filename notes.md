## Autoencoder → VAE

### Why VAEs?
Generative models can make brand-new random outputs, but often you want to **explore/alter existing data** in a specific direction — VAEs are especially good at this.

### Standard Autoencoder
- Two networks: **encoder** (input → small dense encoding) + **decoder** (encoding → reconstruct input)
- Trained via **reconstruction loss** (MSE or cross-entropy between output and input)
- Encoder is forced to discard unimportant info, keep only what's needed to reconstruct

### The problem
- The latent space learned this way is **not continuous** — it forms disconnected clusters
- Fine for reconstructing known inputs, but bad for generation: sampling a random point between clusters → decoder has never seen that region → garbage output

### What VAEs change
- Encoder outputs **two vectors** instead of one encoding: a mean vector **μ** and a std-dev vector **σ**
- These define a distribution per input; the actual encoding is **sampled** from N(μ, σ²)
- Same input → slightly different encoding every pass (stochastic)
- Intuition: μ = where the encoding is centered, σ = how much it's allowed to vary
- Because decoder sees many sampled variations of the same input during training, it learns nearby points in latent space also decode sensibly → smooths the space **locally**

### Loss Function

$$
\mathcal{L}_{VAE} = \mathcal{L}_{recon} + \mathcal{L}_{KL}
$$

#### Reconstruction loss
purely **reconstruction loss**: the same as that used in MLP, can be Binary Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error, etc.

#### KL loss
purely **KL loss**: Pulls all encodings toward the center, densely packed, evenly spread
- Add KL divergence term to the loss: penalizes how far the learned distribution (μ, σ) is from a standard normal N(0, I)

#### Both together

### Code

#### Encoding section: encoder + reparameterization trick

```python
# build your encoder upto here. It can simply be a series of dense layers, a convolutional network
# or even an LSTM decoder. Once made, flatten out the final layer of the encoder, call it hidden.

# we use Keras to build the graph

latent_size = 5
mean = Dense(latent_size)(hidden)

# we usually don't directly compute the stddev σ 
# but the log of the stddev instead, which is log(σ)
# the reasoning is similar to why we use softmax, instead of directly outputting
# numbers in fixed range [0, 1], the network can output a wider range of numbers which we can later compress down
log_stddev = Dense(latent_size)(hidden)

def sampler(mean, log_stddev):
    # we sample from the standard normal a matrix of batch_size * latent_size (taking into account minibatches)
    std_norm = K.random_normal(shape=(K.shape(mean)[0], latent_size), mean=0, stddev=1)
    # sampling from Z~N(μ, σ^2) is the same as sampling from μ + σX, X~N(0,1)
    return mean + K.exp(log_stddev) * std_norm
  
latent_vector = Lambda(sampler)([mean, log_stddev])
# pass latent_vector as input to decoder layers
```

#### Loss section

```python
def vae_loss(input_img, output):
    # compute the average MSE error, then scale it up i.e. simply sum on all axes
    reconstruction_loss = K.sum(K.square(output-input_img))
    # compute the KL loss
    kl_loss = -0.5 * K.sum(1 + log_stddev - K.square(mean) - K.square(K.exp(log_stddev)), axis=-1)
    # return the average loss over all images in batch
    total_loss = K.mean(reconstruction_loss + kl_loss)
    return total_loss
```

- **Edges**: GAN fakes sharper/more defined; VAE reconstructions smoother, slightly blurred
- **Why VAE never outputs garbage**: KL term regularizes the *entire* latent space (not just regions near real images) → every sampled `z`, even from pure noise (`epsilon` in the reparam trick), lands somewhere the decoder learned as "valid"
- **Why GAN sometimes does**: G only gets gradient signal from noise vectors actually sampled during training — no constraint forcing the *whole* noise space to map to valid digits → under-visited regions can produce non-digit garbage (structurally impossible for VAE)
- **Consistency**: VAE reconstructions uniformly legible across all samples; GAN fakes more variable — mostly good, occasional unreadable outlier
- **Takeaway**: GAN trades consistency for sharper best-case quality; VAE trades peak sharpness for reliability

### GAN loss (oscillating)

| Epoch | D_loss | G_loss |
|---|---|---|
| 0  | 1.1201 | 1.0048 |
| 10 | 1.3218 | 0.5493 |
| 20 | 1.1424 | 1.1971 |
| 30 | 1.2966 | 1.0813 |
| 40 | 1.1554 | 1.2668 |
| 50 | 1.1264 | 1.1294 |
| 60 | 1.2184 | 1.2075 |
| 70 | 1.1017 | 1.3040 |
| 80 | 0.9159 | 1.3171 |
| 90 | 0.9009 | 1.8837 |
| 99 | 0.9974 | 1.3613 |

- VAE loss is **monotonic**: 146 → 106 over 100 epochs, no epoch where loss 
  increases from the last. Single loss, single optimizer, encoder+decoder 
  cooperate on one objective — nothing fights the descent.
- GAN loss **oscillates**: D_loss and G_loss both move up and down throughout 
  training (D: 0.90–1.32, G: 0.55–1.88), never settling monotonically. Two 
  networks with opposing objectives share the same landscape — every update 
  to one changes what the other is optimizing against.
- This is **not collapse or failure** — no loss pinned near 0, samples stayed 
  legible throughout (see sample quality section). Oscillation here reflects 
  the adversarial minimax structure itself, not broken training.
- Takeaway: VAE's stability is structural (cooperative, single objective); 
  GAN's instability is also structural (adversarial, dual objective) — not a 
  sign either network failed, just an inherent property of each architecture.


**Latent space**: [your sentence above]

**GAN's advantage**: sharper, more realistic-looking outputs at the pixel level.
**GAN's cost**: unstable training (two competing losses vs one), no structured 
latent space, harder to debug when something goes wrong (loss numbers alone 
don't tell you if it's working — must eyeball samples).
